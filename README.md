# Kruskal-algorithm
This program demonstrate the progress of finding the smallest spanning tree which using Kruskal-algorithm.
The input file will be create randomly by running the file inputkuscal.cpp.
The output will be printed in file named Kruskal.txt which show you all step of chosing edges of the spanning tree.
